# Headlight NYC Engineering Tournament
# Gothic City Villain Identification

Completed for the Headlight NYC Engineering Tournament during the weekend of 4/20 - 4/22.

This is a modular React based front end SPA that enables a history of photo submissions to the Headlight API. 

This requires a `.env` file with a `REACT_APP_API_KEY` key in the root directory.
