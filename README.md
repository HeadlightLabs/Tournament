Your task will be to design an application that:

* Allows users to upload photos

* Transmits those photos the Wayne Corp API that will tell you:

  * The closest match to a villain, if any
  * The % match (with 100% being a perfect match)

* Allows users to browse their results

* Allows users to report an individual if they believe it matches a known villain
  * This report mechanism will also be done through the Wayne Corp API
